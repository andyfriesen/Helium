# Helium

Happy Haskell Hacking With [Atom](http://atom.io)

Helium is a tiny plugin that connects Atom to [ghc-mod](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/ghc-mod).
ghc-mod can check syntax, inspect the types of sub expressions and a bunch of
other things.

Helium can show you errors in your code:

It can also fill in type annotations sometimes:

# Status

This project is only about ~~4~~ 12 hours in.  Beware: thar be dragons. :D

# Installation

```shell
apm install helium
```

If you want to get the source directly (eg to hack on it (please, hack on it!)), you can just check it out into your
`~/.atom/packages` directory.
