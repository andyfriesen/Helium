# Helium

Happy Haskell Hacking With [Atom](http://atom.io)

Helium is a tiny plugin that connects Atom to [ghc-mod](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/ghc-mod).
ghc-mod can check syntax, inspect the types of sub expressions and a bunch of
other things.  It's great.

Helium can show you errors in your code:

It can also fill in type annotations sometimes:
